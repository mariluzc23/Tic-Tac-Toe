# TicTacToe
This is a TicTacToe gameboard that can be played in the terminal/console. 
It is inspired by the youtuber Alex Lee with a minor adjustment: 
one bug fix with a variable delcaration and 
the gameboard is printed everytime right before announcing the winner.
I utilized this as practice to learn the java language.
